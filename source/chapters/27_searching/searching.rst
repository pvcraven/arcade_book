Searching
=========

Searching is an important and very common operation that computers do all the
time. Searches are used every time someone does a ctrl-f for "find", when a
user uses "type-to" to quickly select an item, or when a web server pulls
information about a customer to present a customized web page with the
customer's order.

There are a lot of ways to search for data. Google has based an entire
multi-billion dollar company on this fact. This chapter introduces the two
simplest methods for searching, the linear search and the binary search.

.. _reading-from-a-file:

Reading From a File
-------------------

.. raw:: html

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fEkuldnH75c?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Before discussing how to search we need to learn how to read data from a file.
Reading in a data set from a file is way more fun than typing it in by hand
each time.

Let's say we need to create a program that will allow us to quickly find the
name of a super-villain. To start with, our program needs a database of
super-villains. To download this data set, download and save this file:

`super_villains.txt`_

.. _super_villains.txt: ../../_static/super_villains.txt

These are random names generated by the `nine.frenchboys.net`_ website, although
last I checked they no longer have a super-villain generator. They have other cool
random name generators though.

.. _nine.frenchboys.net: http://nine.frenchboys.net/

Save this file and remember which directory you saved it to.

In the same directory as ``super_villains.txt``, create, save, and run the
following Python program:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: Read in a file
    :emphasize-lines: 6, 9

    def main():
        """ Read in lines from a file """

        # Open the file for reading, and store a pointer to it in the new
        # variable "file"
        my_file = open("super_villains.txt")

        # Loop through each line in the file like a list
        for line in my_file:
            print(line)


    main()

There is only one new command in this code: ``open``. Because it is a built-in
function like ``print``, there is no need for an ``import``. Full details on this
function can be found in the `Python documentation`_ but at this point the
documentation for that command is so technical it might not even be worth
looking at.

.. _Python documentation: http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/functions.html#open

The above program has two problems with it, but it provides a simple example
of reading in a file. Line 6 opens a file and gets it ready to be read. The
name of the file is in between the quotes. The new variable ``my_file`` is an object
that represents the file being read. Line 9 shows how a normal ``for`` loop may be
used to read through a file line by line. Think of the file as a list of lines,
and the new variable line will be set to each of those lines as the program
runs through the loop.

Try running the program. One of the problems with the it is that the text is
printed double-spaced:

.. code-block:: text

    Adolphus of Helborne

    Aldric Foxe

    Amanita Maleficant

    Aphra the Vicious

    Arachne the Gruesome

    (etc...)

The reason for this is that each line pulled out of the
file and stored in the variable line includes the carriage return as part of
the string. Remember the carriage return and line feed introduced back in
Chapter 1? The ``print`` statement adds yet another carriage return and the result
is double-spaced output.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: Read in a file
    :emphasize-lines: 11

    def main():
        """ Read in lines from a file """

        # Open the file for reading, and store a pointer to it in the new
        # variable "file"
        my_file = open("super_villains.txt")

        # Loop through each line in the file like a list
        for line in my_file:
            # Remove any line feed, carriage returns or spaces at the end of the line
            line = line.strip()
            print(line)


    main()

The listing above works better. It has one new addition. On line 11 is a call
to the ``strip`` method built into every ``String`` class. This function returns a new
string without the trailing spaces and carriage returns of the original string.
The method does not alter the original string but instead creates a new one.
Now when we run the program the lines are not double-spaced:

.. code-block:: text

    Adolphus of Helborne
    Aldric Foxe
    Amanita Maleficant
    Aphra the Vicious
    Arachne the Gruesome
    (etc...)

This line of code would not work:

.. code-block:: python

    line.strip()

Just like ``x = x + 1`` increases ``x``, but not ``x + 1``.

The second problem is that the file is opened, but not closed. This problem
isn't as obvious as the double-spacing issue, but it is important. The Windows
operating system can only open so many files at once. A file can normally only
be opened by one program at a time. Leaving a file open will limit what other
programs can do with the file and take up system resources. It is necessary to
close the file to let Windows know the program is no longer working with that
file. In this case it is not too important because once any program is done
running, the Windows will automatically close any files left open. But since
it is a bad habit to program like that, let's update the code:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: Read in a file
    :emphasize-lines: 14

    def main():
        """ Read in lines from a file """

        # Open the file for reading, and store a pointer to it in the new
        # variable "file"
        my_file = open("super_villains.txt")

        # Loop through each line in the file like a list
        for line in my_file:
            # Remove any line feed, carriage returns or spaces at the end of the line
            line = line.strip()
            print(line)

        my_file.close()


    main()

The listing above works better. Line 14 closes the file so that the operating
system doesn't have to go around later and clean up open files after the
program ends.

However, what if there is an error reading in the file? We might not hit the ``close()``
command. In that case, Python has a command called ``with`` that will automatically close
the file once we leave the block of code inside ``with``:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: Read in a file using 'with'
    :emphasize-lines: 4-5

    def main():
        """ Read in lines from a file """

        # Open file, and automatically close when we exit this block.
        with open("super_villains.txt") as my_file:

            # Loop through each line in the file like a list
            for line in my_file:
                line = line.strip()
                print(line)


    main()

This is considered the safer, and more "modern" way of reading in files.

.. _reading_into_an_array:

Reading Into an Array
---------------------

It is useful to read in the contents of a file to an array so that the
program can do processing on it later. This can easily be done in python with
the following code:


.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: Read in a file from disk and put it in an array
    :emphasize-lines: 8-9, 16-17, 21

    def main():
        """ Read in lines from a file """

        # Open the file for reading, and store a pointer to it in the new
        # variable "file"
        my_file = open("super_villains.txt")

        # Create an empty list to store our names
        name_list = []

        # Loop through each line in the file like a list
        for line in my_file:
            # Remove any line feed, carriage returns or spaces at the end of the line
            line = line.strip()

            # Add the name to the list
            name_list.append(line)

        my_file.close()

        print( "There were", len(name_list), "names in the file.")


    main()

This combines the new pattern of how to read a file, along with the previously
learned pattern of how to create an empty array and append to it as new data
comes in, which was shown back in :ref:`append_to_list`. To verify the file was read into
the array correctly a programmer could print the length of the array:

.. code-block:: python

    print( "There were",len(name_list),"names in the file.")

Or the programmer could print the entire contents of the array:

.. code-block:: python

    for name in name_list:
        print(name)

Go ahead and make sure you can read in the file before continuing on to the
different searches.

Linear Search
-------------

If a program has a set of data in an array, how can it go about finding where
a specific element is? This can be done one of two ways. The first method is
to use a *linear search*. This starts at the first element, and keeps comparing
elements until it finds the desired element (or runs out of elements.)

.. _linear_search:

Linear Search Algorithm
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PiexZxsiLT8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: Linear search

    # --- Linear search
    key = "Morgiana the Shrew"

    # Start at the beginning of the list
    current_list_position = 0

    # Loop until you reach the end of the list, or the value at the
    # current position is equal to the key
    while current_list_position < len(name_list) and name_list[current_list_position] != key:

        # Advance to the next item in the list
        current_list_position += 1

    if current_list_position < len(name_list):
        print("The name is at position", current_list_position)
    else:
        print("The name was not in the list.")

The linear search is rather simple. Line 5 sets up an increment variable that
will keep track of exactly where in the list the program needs to check next.
The first element that needs to be checked is zero, so ``current_list_position`` is set to zero.

The next line is a bit more complex. The computer needs to keep looping until
one of two things happens. It finds the element, or it runs out of elements.
The first comparison sees if the current element we are checking is less than
the length of the list. If so, we can keep looping. The second comparison sees
if the current element in the name list is equal to the name we are searching
for.

This check to see if the program has run out of elements *must occur first*.
Otherwise the program will check against a non-existent element which will
cause an error.

Line 12 simply moves to the next element if the conditions to keep searching
are met in line 9.

At the end of the loop, the program checks to see if the end of the list was
reached on line 14. Remember, a list of n elements is numbered 0 to n-1.
Therefore if i is equal to the length of the list, the end has been reached.
If it is less, we found the element.

The full example with both the reading in the file and the search is below:

.. literalinclude:: linear_search.py
    :linenos:
    :language: Python
    :caption: Linear search


We can improve on this example by moving both the reading of the file and the
search into their own functions:

.. literalinclude:: linear_search_with_functions.py
    :linenos:
    :language: Python
    :caption: Linear search

Variations On The Linear Search
-------------------------------

Variations on the linear search can be used to create several common
algorithms. Specifically, you can use it to see if *any* items in a list
match a property, or if *all* items match a property. You can also use it to
pull all matching items out of a list.

Does At Least One Item Have a Property?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For example, here is a function that uses the linear search to see if there
is an item in ``my_list`` that matches the value in ``key``.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: check_if_one_item_has_property_v1

    def check_if_one_item_has_property_v1(my_list, key):
        """
        Return true if at least one item has a
        property.
        """
        list_position = 0
        while list_position < len(my_list) and my_list[list_position] != key:
            list_position += 1

        if list_position < len(my_list):
            # Found an item with the property
            return True
        else:
            # There is no item with the property
            return False


We can simplify the code by using a ``return`` statement inside an ``if``
statement:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: check_if_one_item_has_property_v2

    def check_if_one_item_has_property_v2(my_list, key):
        """
        Return true if at least one item has a
        property.
        """
        for item in my_list:
            if item == key:
                # Found an item that matched. Return True
                return True

        # Went through the whole list. Return False.
        return False

Do All Items Have a Property?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How would you test to see if *all* items in a list match a property? We just
need to reverse a few things in the algorithm above.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: check_if_all_items_have_property

    def check_if_all_items_have_property(my_list, key):
        """
        Return true if at ALL items have a property.
        """
        for item in my_list:
            if item != key:
                # Found an item that didn't match. Return False.
                return False

        # Got through the entire list. There were no mis-matches.
        return True



Create a List With All Items Matching a Property
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another common operation is to grab all the items out of a list that match:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: get_matching_items

    def get_matching_items(my_list, key):
        """
        Build a brand new list that holds all the items
        that match our property.
        """
        matching_list = []
        for item in my_list:
            if item == key:
                matching_list.append(item)
        return matching_list


Full Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a full example, see below:

.. literalinclude:: linear_search_variations_2.py
    :caption: linear_search_variations_2.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:


Variations On The Linear Search With Objects
--------------------------------------------

For example, say we had a list of objects for our text adventure.
We might want to check that list and see if any of the items are in the same
room as our player. Or if all the items are. Or we might want to build a list
of items that the user is carrying if they are all in a "special" room that
represents the player's inventory.

To begin with, we'd need to define our adventure object:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: Adventure Object class

    class AdventureObject:
        """ Class that defines an object in a text adventure game """

        def __init__(self, description, room):
            """ Constructor."""

            # Description of the object
            self.description = description

            # The number of the room that the object is in
            self.room = room

Does At Least One Item Have a Property?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Is at least one object in the specified room? We can check.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: Check if list has an item that has a property - ``while`` loop

    def check_if_one_item_is_in_room_v1(my_list, room):
        """
        Return true if at least one item has a
        property.
        """
        i = 0
        while i < len(my_list) and my_list[i].room != room:
            i += 1

        if i < len(my_list):
            # Found an item with the property
            return True
        else:
            # There is no item with the property
            return False

This could also be done with a ``for`` loop. In this case, the loop will exit
early by using a ``return`` once the item has been found. The code is shorter,
but not every programmer would prefer it. Some programmers feel that loops
should not be prematurely ended with a ``return`` or ``break`` statement. It all goes
to personal preference, or the personal preference of the person that is
footing the bill.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: Check if list has an item that has a property - ``for`` loop

    def check_if_one_item_is_in_room_v2(my_list, room):
        """
        Return true if at least one item has a
        property. Works the same as v1, but less code.
        """
        for item in my_list:
            if item.room == room:
                return True
        return False

Do All Items Have a Property?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Are all the adventure objects in the same room? This code is very similar to the prior example. Spot
the difference and see if you can figure out the reason behind the change.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: Check if all items have a property

    def check_if_all_items_are_in_room(my_list, room):
        """
        Return true if at ALL items have a property.
        """
        for item in my_list:
            if item.room != room:
                return False
        return True

Create a List With All Items Matching a Property
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What if you wanted a list of objects that are in room 5? This is a combination of
our prior code, and the code to append items to a list that we learned about
back in :ref:`intro-to-lists`.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: Create another list with all items matching a property

    def get_items_in_room(my_list, room):
        """
        Build a brand new list that holds all the items
        that match our property.
        """
        matching_list = []
        for item in my_list:
            if item.room == room:
                matching_list.append(item)
        return matching_list

How would you run all these in a test? The code above can be combined with
this code to run:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: Run Sample Functions

    def main():
        object_list = []
        object_list.append(AdventureObject("Key", 5))
        object_list.append(AdventureObject("Bear", 5))
        object_list.append(AdventureObject("Food", 8))
        object_list.append(AdventureObject("Sword", 2))
        object_list.append(AdventureObject("Wand", 10))

        result = check_if_one_item_has_property_v1(object_list, 5)
        print("Result of test check_if_one_item_has_property_v1:", result)

        result = check_if_one_item_has_property_v2(object_list, 5)
        print("Result of test check_if_one_item_has_property_v2:", result)

        result = check_if_all_items_have_property(object_list, 5)
        print("Result of test check_if_all_items_have_property:", result)

        result = get_matching_items(object_list, 5)
        print("Number of items returned from test get_matching_items:", len(result))


    main()

For a full working example:

.. literalinclude:: linear_search_variations.py

These common algorithms can be used as part of a solution to a larger problem,
such as find all the addresses in a list of customers that aren't valid.

.. _binary_search:

Binary Search
-------------

.. raw:: html

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IfJIFqAxW9I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A faster way to search a list is possible with the binary search. The process
of a binary search can be described by using the classic number guessing game
"guess a number between 1 and 100" as an example. To make it easier to
understand the process, let's modify the game to be
"guess a number between 1 and 128." The number range is inclusive, meaning
both 1 and 128 are possibilities.

If a person were to use the linear search as a method to guess the secret
number, the game would be rather long and boring.

.. code-block:: text

    Guess a number 1 to 128: 1
    Too low.
    Guess a number 1 to 128: 2
    Too low.
    Guess a number 1 to 128: 3
    Too low.
    ....
    Guess a number 1 to 128: 93
    Too low.
    Guess a number 1 to 128: 94
    Correct!

Most people will use a binary search to find the number. Here is an example of playing the game using a binary search:

.. code-block:: text

    Guess a number 1 to 128: 64
    Too low.
    Guess a number 1 to 128: 96
    Too high.
    Guess a number 1 to 128: 80
    Too low.
    Guess a number 1 to 128: 88
    Too low.
    Guess a number 1 to 128: 92
    Too low.
    Guess a number 1 to 128: 94
    Correct!

Each time through the rounds of the number guessing game, the guesser is able
to eliminate one half of the problem space by getting a "high" or "low" as a
result of the guess.

In a binary search, it is necessary to track an upper and a lower bound of the
list that the answer can be in. The computer or number-guessing human picks the
midpoint of those elements. Revisiting the example:

A lower bound of 1, upper bound of 128, mid point
of :math:`\frac{128+1}{2}=64.5`.

.. code-block:: text

    Guess a number 1 to 128: 64
    Too low.

A lower bound of 65, upper bound of 128, mid point of
:math:`\frac{65+128}{2}=96.5`.

.. code-block:: text

    Guess a number 1 to 128: 96
    Too high.

A lower bound of 65, upper bound of 95, mid point of
:math:`\frac{65+95}{2}=80`.

.. code-block:: text

    Guess a number 1 to 128: 80
    Too low.

A lower bound of 81, upper bound of 95, mid point of
:math:`\frac{81+95}{2}=88`.

.. code-block:: text

    Guess a number 1 to 128: 88
    Too low.

A lower bound of 89, upper bound of 95, mid point of
:math:`\frac{89+95}{2}=92`.

.. code-block:: text

    Guess a number 1 to 128: 92
    Too low.

A lower bound of 93, upper bound of 95, mid point of
:math:`\frac{93+95}{2}=94`.

.. code-block:: text

    Guess a number 1 to 128: 94
    Correct!

A binary search requires significantly fewer guesses. Worst case, it can
guess a number between 1 and 128 in 7 guesses. One more guess raises the
limit to 256. 9 guesses can get a number between 1 and 512. With just 32
guesses, a person can get a number between 1 and 4.2 billion.

To figure out how large the list can be given a certain number of guesses,
the formula works out like :math:`n=x^{g}` where :math:`n` is the size of the
list and :math:`g` is the number of guesses. For example:

| :math:`2^7=128` (7 guesses can handle 128 different numbers)
| :math:`2^8=256`
| :math:`2^9=512`
| :math:`2^{32}=4,294,967,296`

If you have the problem size, we can figure out the number of guesses using
the log function. Specifically, *log base 2*. If you don't specify a base,
most people will assume you mean the natural log with a base of
:math:`e \approx 2.71828` which is not what we want. For example, using
log base 2 to find how many guesses:

| :math:`log_2 128 = 7`
| :math:`log_2 65,536 = 16`
|

Enough math! Where is the code? The code to do a binary search is more complex
than a linear search:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Binary search
    :linenos:

    # --- Binary search
    key = "Morgiana the Shrew"
    lower_bound = 0
    upper_bound = len(name_list)-1
    found = False

    # Loop until we find the item, or our upper/lower bounds meet
    while lower_bound <= upper_bound and not found:

        # Find the middle position
        middle_pos = (lower_bound + upper_bound) // 2

        # Figure out if we:
        # move up the lower bound, or
        # move down the upper bound, or
        # we found what we are looking for
        if name_list[middle_pos] < key:
            lower_bound = middle_pos + 1
        elif name_list[middle_pos] > key:
            upper_bound = middle_pos - 1
        else:
            found = True

    if found:
        print( "The name is at position", middle_pos)
    else:
        print( "The name was not in the list." )

Since lists start at element zero, line 3 sets the lower bound to zero.
Line 4 sets the upper bound to the length of the list minus one. So for a
list of 100 elements the lower bound will be 0 and the upper bound 99.

The Boolean variable on line 5 will be used to let the while loop know that the
element has been found.

Line 8 checks to see if the element has been found or if we've run out of
elements. If we've run out of elements the lower bound will end up equaling
the upper bound.

Line 11 finds the middle position. It is possible to get a middle position
of something like 64.5. It isn't possible to look up position 64.5.
(Although J.K. Rowling was rather clever in enough coming up with Platform
:math:`9\frac{3}{4}`, that doesn't work here.) The best way of handling
this is to use the ``//`` operator first introduced way back in Chapter 1.
This is similar to the ``/`` operator, but will only return integer results.
For example, ``11 // 2`` would give 5 as an answer, rather than 5.5.

Starting at line 17, the program checks to see if the guess is high, low, or
correct. If the guess is low, the lower bound is moved up to just past the
guess. If the guess is too high, the upper bound is moved just below
the guess. If the answer has been found, ``found`` is set to ``True``
ending the search.

With the a list of 100 elements, a person can reasonably guess that on
average with the linear search, a program will have to check 50 of them
before finding the element. With the binary search, on average you'll
still need to do about seven guesses. In an advanced algorithms course
you can find the exact formula. For this course, just assume average and
worst cases are the same.
