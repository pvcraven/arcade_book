"Throughout this course we've been using variables to store *a* value. We "

"advantages. One, we can group multiple variables together in a single "
"record. Two, we can associate functions with that group of data. Three, "
"we can use something called **inheritance** which allows us to take a "
"base set of code and extend it, without needing to rewrite it from "
